Movie Suggestion App

This Angular application allows users to search for movies, suggest part two of a movie, and view other users' recommendations. The application fetches movie data from The Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.
Features

    Search Movies: The application allows users to search for movies from the OMDb API. It provides a responsive and efficient user experience by triggering the API call only when the user has typed at least three characters and stops typing for at least a second.

    Movie Suggestions: Users can suggest a sequel to a movie by filling in a form that captures the type of suggestion (new movie or sequel), the reason for the suggestion, and an optional image upload for the movie's billboard.

  View Recommendations: Submitted movie recommendations are saved to the localStorage and displayed user-friendly. Users can scroll through the recommendations to see what others have suggested.
